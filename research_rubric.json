    "summary": "The reverse-and-add process takes a number, reverses its digits, and adds the result to the original. Most numbers eventually reach a palindrome. The Most Delayed Palindromic Number is the number requiring the most iterations before becoming palindromic. The current world record is 293 iterations (set December 2021 by Dmitry Maslov for the 25-digit number 1,000,206,827,388,999,999,095,750). No new record has been set in over 4 years. We aim to find a number requiring 294+ iterations, setting a new world record. Verification is trivial: given candidate N, run reverse-and-add in Python and count iterations until palindrome.",
