## Part A: Uniform Lattices in Semisimple Lie Groups with Torsion (Item 002)

### Reference 1: Selberg (1960) — Selberg's Lemma
**Key:** `selberg1960`

**Result.** Every finitely generated subgroup of GL(n, ℂ) contains a torsion-free subgroup of finite index. In particular, every lattice Γ in a real semisimple Lie group G (with finite center) is virtually torsion-free.

**Relevance.** This is the foundational result guaranteeing that every lattice Γ has a torsion-free subgroup Γ' of finite index. The quotient Γ'\G/K is then a compact manifold (when Γ is uniform) and is a K(Γ', 1). The question asks whether we can realize the full Γ (with its 2-torsion) as π₁(M) with ℚ-acyclic universal cover, rather than just the torsion-free subgroup.

### Reference 2: Borel (1963) — Compact Clifford–Klein Forms
**Key:** `borel1963`

**Result.** Every Riemannian symmetric space G/K of non-compact type admits a compact Clifford–Klein form, i.e., there exists a torsion-free cocompact lattice Γ ⊂ G such that Γ\G/K is a compact manifold.

**Relevance.** Borel's construction gives compact aspherical manifolds as quotients of symmetric spaces. However, these have torsion-FREE fundamental groups. The question asks about lattices WITH torsion.

### Reference 3: Borel and Serre (1973) — Corners and Arithmetic Groups
**Key:** `borelserre1973`

**Result.** For an arithmetic group Γ in a semisimple algebraic group G defined over ℚ, the Borel–Serre compactification X̄^BS of the symmetric space X = G/K is a contractible manifold with corners on which Γ acts properly. The quotient Γ\X̄^BS is a compact manifold with corners.

**Key consequences:**
- Γ is a virtual duality group of dimension dim(X) − rank_ℚ(G).
- The virtual cohomological dimension vcd(Γ) = dim(X) − rank_ℚ(G) for non-uniform lattices, and vcd(Γ) = dim(X) for uniform lattices.
- The Borel–Serre boundary ∂X̄^BS is homotopy equivalent to the Tits building.

**Relevance.** For uniform lattices, vcd(Γ) = dim(G/K), and Γ is a virtual Poincaré duality group. This constrains the dimension of any closed manifold M with π₁(M) = Γ and ℚ-acyclic universal cover.

### Reference 4: Raghunathan (1984) — Torsion in Cocompact Lattices in Coverings of Spin(2,n)
**Key:** `raghunathan1984`

**Result.** Raghunathan studies torsion elements in cocompact lattices in the universal covering group of Spin(2, n). He shows that certain arithmetic cocompact lattices in these groups contain non-trivial torsion elements, even in the universal covering.

**Relevance.** Provides explicit examples of cocompact lattices with torsion in groups related to SO(2, n). These serve as test cases for our question.

### Reference 5: Gelander (PCMI 2012 lectures) — Lectures on Lattices
**Key:** `gelander2012`

**Result.** Survey of lattice theory covering: existence, construction, Selberg's lemma, strong rigidity (Mostow), superrigidity (Margulis), arithmeticity, and properties of lattices in semisimple groups.

**Key points:**
- A discrete group Γ ≤ Isom(Hⁿ) acts freely on Hⁿ iff it is torsion-free.
- If Γ has torsion, Γ\X is an orbifold, not a manifold.
- By Margulis arithmeticity, in rank ≥ 2, all lattices are arithmetic.

### Reference 6: Benoist (2004) — Five Lectures on Lattices in Semisimple Lie Groups
**Key:** `benoist2004`

**Result.** Comprehensive overview of lattice theory in semisimple groups, covering existence of lattices, properties of arithmetic and non-arithmetic lattices, and geometric consequences.

---

### Reference 7: Gelander and Slutsky (2023) — A Quantitative Selberg's Lemma
**Key:** `gelanderslutsky2023`

**Result.** An arithmetic lattice Γ in a semi-simple Lie group G contains a torsion-free subgroup of index δ(v) where v = μ(G/Γ). The bound δ is polynomial in general and polylogarithmic under GRH. They construct lattices with torsion elements of order ~log v/log log v, showing the bound is near-optimal.

**Relevance.** Shows that torsion in arithmetic lattices is ubiquitous and cannot be avoided without passing to finite-index subgroups.

---

### Reference 8: Margulis (1991) — Discrete Subgroups of Semisimple Lie Groups
**Key:** `margulis1991`

**Result.** Margulis's monograph establishing superrigidity and arithmeticity theorems for lattices in semisimple Lie groups of real rank ≥ 2. Key result: every irreducible lattice in a semisimple Lie group G with rank_ℝ(G) ≥ 2 is arithmetic.

**Relevance.** In higher rank, all uniform lattices are arithmetic, so torsion structure is determined by the arithmetic construction.

---

### Reference 9: Bergeron and Venkatesh (2013) — The Asymptotic Growth of Torsion Homology for Arithmetic Groups
**Key:** `bergeronvenkatesh2013`

**Result.** For a cocompact arithmetic group Γ ⊂ G, the torsion in cohomology H_i(Γ_k; ℤ) grows exponentially in [Γ : Γ_k] when i = (dim(D) − 1)/2 and G has δ(G) = 1 (deficiency 1).

**Relevance.** Shows that arithmetic lattices have rich torsion phenomena in their cohomology, relevant to understanding H*(Γ; ℤ) vs H*(Γ; ℚ).

---

### Reference 10: Kobayashi and Yoshino (2005) — Compact Clifford–Klein Forms Revisited
**Key:** `kobayashiyoshino2005`

**Result.** Survey of the existence problem for compact Clifford–Klein forms, especially in the non-Riemannian case. Complete classification of which symmetric spaces G/H admit compact quotients Γ\G/H.

**Relevance.** Extends Borel's work to non-Riemannian settings. Shows that the existence of cocompact lattices acting on symmetric spaces depends subtly on the pair (G, H).
