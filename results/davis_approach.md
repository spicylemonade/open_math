# Approach B: Davis-Type Constructions

## 1. Review of Davis's Construction

### The Reflection Group Trick

Davis's fundamental insight \cite{davis1983} is that right-angled Coxeter groups provide a powerful tool for constructing aspherical manifolds. The construction proceeds as follows:

**Input:** A finite flag complex L (every minimal non-face is an edge).

**Construction:**
1. Let (W, S) be the right-angled Coxeter group with nerve L. The generators S = {s_1, ..., s_n} correspond to vertices of L, with relations s_i² = 1 and (s_is_j)² = 1 when {i,j} is an edge of L.
2. The **Davis complex** Σ = Σ(W, S) is a CAT(0) cubical complex on which W acts properly and cocompactly. The fundamental domain is K, a compact manifold with corners (a "mirrored manifold").
3. If L is a (generalized) homology sphere of dimension (n-1), then Σ is a contractible n-manifold and K is a compact n-manifold with boundary.

**Key properties:**
- W acts on Σ with finite stabilizers (all conjugate to finite subgroups generated by subsets of S).
- Every generator s_i ∈ W has order 2 (this is 2-torsion!).
- Σ is contractible (it's CAT(0) and complete).
- If Γ' ⊂ W is a torsion-free, finite-index subgroup (exists by Selberg's lemma), then M' = Γ'\Σ is a closed aspherical manifold with π₁(M') = Γ'.

## 2. Can This Be Adapted for Our Problem?

### The Goal

We want a closed manifold M with:
- π₁(M) = Γ (a uniform lattice in a semisimple group, with 2-torsion)
- M̃ is ℚ-acyclic (but NOT necessarily contractible)

### Obstacle 1: Davis Groups Are Coxeter Groups, Not Semisimple Lattices

The Davis construction produces manifolds whose fundamental groups are torsion-free subgroups of Coxeter groups. These are NOT lattices in semisimple Lie groups in general.

**However:** Some Coxeter groups ARE (virtually) lattices in semisimple Lie groups. For example:
- Hyperbolic reflection groups in SO(n, 1) are Coxeter groups that are uniform lattices.
- But these are finite Coxeter groups or hyperbolic Coxeter groups, not right-angled in general.

The right-angled Coxeter groups used in Davis's construction are typically NOT lattices in classical semisimple Lie groups (they act on the Davis complex, which is a CAT(0) cube complex, not a symmetric space).

### Obstacle 2: Asphericity Forces Torsion-Freeness

The Davis construction produces aspherical manifolds (contractible universal cover). Any torsion element in π₁ would contradict the asphericity (finite groups have non-trivial cohomology in infinitely many degrees). So the manifold quotient M' = Γ'\Σ requires Γ' to be torsion-free.

**This is the fundamental obstacle:** the Davis trick produces aspherical manifolds, which forces torsion-free fundamental groups. Our question asks for ℚ-acyclicity (not contractibility), which should allow torsion.

## 3. Modified Approach: Rationally Acyclic but Not Contractible

### Idea: Replace Contractible Complex with ℚ-Acyclic Complex

Instead of the Davis complex Σ (which is contractible), suppose we could construct a ℚ-acyclic but not contractible space Σ' on which a group W' (containing 2-torsion) acts freely and cocompactly. Then M = W'\Σ' would be a closed manifold with π₁(M) = W' and ℚ-acyclic universal cover.

**Key question:** Can such a Σ' be constructed?

### Connection to Bestvina–Brady

The Bestvina–Brady construction \cite{bestvinabrady1997} produces groups that are of type FP (over ℚ) but have non-contractible classifying spaces. Specifically:

For a flag complex L that is ℚ-acyclic but not contractible (e.g., L has non-trivial fundamental group but H̃_*(L; ℚ) = 0), the Bestvina–Brady group BB(L) is the kernel of the map A_L → ℤ (from the right-angled Artin group to ℤ, sending each generator to 1). The group BB(L) has:
- Type FP over ℚ (and over ℤ, if L is ℤ-acyclic).
- But BB(L) is NOT finitely presented when L is not simply connected.

**Problem:** Bestvina–Brady groups are torsion-free (as subgroups of right-angled Artin groups, which are torsion-free). So they don't directly help with our 2-torsion requirement.

### Obstacle 3: Torsion and Free Actions on ℚ-Acyclic Spaces

For a group with 2-torsion to act freely on a finite-dimensional ℚ-acyclic space, we need the ℤ/2 subgroup to act freely. Since the space is only ℚ-acyclic (not ℤ/2-acyclic), Smith theory does not prevent this. But constructing such an action is non-trivial.

**Concrete approach:** Start with a torsion-free lattice Γ' acting on a contractible manifold X (e.g., a symmetric space), giving a closed aspherical manifold M' = Γ'\X. Now consider a finite extension 1 → Γ' → Γ → F → 1 where F is a finite group containing ℤ/2. The group Γ acts on X (since Γ contains Γ' as a normal subgroup), but not freely (the torsion elements have fixed points on X).

**Modified idea:** Instead of X, construct a new space Y (a Γ-space) that is:
- ℚ-acyclic
- Admits a free Γ-action
- Is a manifold

This requires "killing" the ℤ/2-acyclicity of X while preserving ℚ-acyclicity and ensuring freeness.

### Obstacle 4: How to Kill ℤ/2-Homology

To ensure that ℤ/2-torsion elements act freely on Y, we need Y to NOT be ℤ/2-acyclic (otherwise Smith theory would force fixed points for any ℤ/2-action). One approach: let Y be ℚ-acyclic but have non-trivial H_*(Y; ℤ/2).

**Construction idea:** Start with the universal cover M̃' of the aspherical manifold M' = Γ'\G/K. This is X = G/K (contractible). Now perform equivariant surgery on X to create a new Γ-space Y:
1. Attach cells to X equivariantly to create non-trivial ℤ/2-homology.
2. Ensure the attachments preserve ℚ-acyclicity.
3. Ensure the result is a manifold with free Γ-action.

This is technically very challenging but not obviously impossible.

## 4. Comparison with Bestvina–Brady Examples

| Feature | Bestvina–Brady | Our Desired Construction |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Group has torsion? | No (torsion-free) | Yes (2-torsion) |
| Universal cover | ℚ-acyclic, not contractible | ℚ-acyclic, not contractible |
| Action | Free | Free |
| Manifold? | No (not finitely presented) | Yes (required) |
| Lattice in semisimple? | No | Yes |

The Bestvina–Brady construction achieves ℚ-acyclicity without contractibility, but for torsion-free groups acting on non-manifold spaces. Our problem requires both torsion AND manifold structure, which is an orthogonal direction.

## 5. Summary: Obstacles and Modifications

### Obstacle 1: Davis groups ≠ semisimple lattices
**Status:** The Davis construction produces Coxeter group quotients, not lattices in classical semisimple groups. However, the underlying IDEA of starting with a group acting on a contractible space and modifying the space is applicable.

### Obstacle 2: Asphericity forces torsion-freeness
**Status:** This IS bypassed by asking for ℚ-acyclicity instead of contractibility. The key insight from our problem analysis.

### Additional Obstacles
- Constructing a free action of a group with 2-torsion on a ℚ-acyclic manifold requires the manifold to NOT be ℤ/2-acyclic.
- Ensuring the quotient is compact requires cocompactness.
- Ensuring the quotient is a manifold requires freeness.

**Overall assessment:** The Davis construction does not directly solve our problem, but the underlying principles (reflection group trick, cubical complexes, hyperbolization) provide relevant techniques. The main adaptation needed is replacing contractibility with ℚ-acyclicity, which requires a fundamentally different construction.
