# Catalog of Uniform Lattices with 2-Torsion in Real Semisimple Lie Groups

## Overview

We catalog known examples of cocompact (uniform) lattices Γ in real semisimple Lie groups G that contain elements of order 2. For each, we identify the ambient group, rank, arithmeticity, source of 2-torsion, and known topological models.

## Example 1: Cocompact Arithmetic Lattice in SO(n, 1) with Reflections

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Ambient group G** | SO(n, 1), the isometry group of real hyperbolic n-space ℍⁿ |
| **Real rank** | 1 |
| **Symmetric space** | ℍⁿ = SO(n,1)/SO(n), dimension n |
| **Arithmetic?** | Yes (arithmetic lattices exist for all n) |
| **Source of 2-torsion** | Reflections in totally geodesic hyperplanes. If Γ contains a reflection r (an isometry with r² = id fixing a codimension-1 totally geodesic submanifold), then r is a 2-torsion element. Arithmetic lattices generated by reflections (hyperbolic reflection groups) contain abundant 2-torsion. |
| **Classifying space model** | E̲Γ = ℍⁿ (symmetric space). The orbifold Γ\ℍⁿ is compact with orbifold singularities along the images of reflection hyperplanes. For a torsion-free subgroup Γ' ⊂ Γ, the quotient Γ'\ℍⁿ is a closed hyperbolic manifold — a K(Γ', 1). |
| **Citation** | \cite{borel1963}, \cite{gelander2012}, \cite{benoist2004} |

**Explicit example:** The group of units of a suitable quadratic form of signature (n, 1) over a totally real number field gives arithmetic cocompact lattices in SO(n, 1). For n ≤ 4, there exist cocompact hyperbolic reflection groups (Vinberg). For n = 2, the triangle groups Δ(p, q, r) with 1/p + 1/q + 1/r < 1 are cocompact lattices in Isom(ℍ²) ≅ PGL(2, ℝ), and those with even parameters contain 2-torsion.

## Example 2: Cocompact Arithmetic Lattice in SU(n, 1) with Involutions

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Ambient group G** | SU(n, 1), acting on complex hyperbolic n-space ℂℍⁿ |
| **Real rank** | 1 |
| **Symmetric space** | ℂℍⁿ = SU(n,1)/S(U(n)×U(1)), real dimension 2n |
| **Arithmetic?** | Yes (via Hermitian forms over CM fields) |
| **Source of 2-torsion** | Anti-holomorphic involutions. Certain arithmetic lattices in SU(n, 1) contain elements of order 2 coming from the Galois involution of the CM field. These act as anti-holomorphic isometries of ℂℍⁿ. Additionally, central elements: the element −I ∈ SU(n, 1) has order 2 when n is odd, and its image in PU(n, 1) is trivial, but lifts to SU(n, 1) give 2-torsion. |
| **Classifying space model** | E̲Γ = ℂℍⁿ. The orbifold Γ\ℂℍⁿ is a complex hyperbolic orbifold. |

## Example 3: Cocompact Lattice in Sp(n, 1) with Quaternionic Involutions

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Ambient group G** | Sp(n, 1), acting on quaternionic hyperbolic n-space ℍℍⁿ |
| **Real rank** | 1 |
| **Symmetric space** | ℍℍⁿ = Sp(n,1)/Sp(n)×Sp(1), real dimension 4n |
| **Arithmetic?** | Yes (all lattices in Sp(n, 1) are arithmetic by Corlette, 1992 / Gromov–Schoen, 1992) |
| **Source of 2-torsion** | Quaternionic conjugation involutions. The center of Sp(n, 1) contains a ℤ/2 element. Arithmetic lattices naturally contain involutions arising from the non-trivial automorphism of quaternion algebras (conjugation). |
| **Classifying space model** | E̲Γ = ℍℍⁿ. |
| **Citation** | \cite{margulis1991}, \cite{gelander2012} |

## Example 4: Cocompact Arithmetic Lattice in SO(2, n) (Higher Rank Case)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Ambient group G** | SO(2, n), for n ≥ 3, acting on symmetric space of real dimension 2n |
| **Real rank** | 2 |
| **Symmetric space** | SO(2,n)/(SO(2)×SO(n)), dimension 2n |
| **Arithmetic?** | Yes (Margulis arithmeticity applies for rank ≥ 2) |
| **Source of 2-torsion** | Raghunathan (1984) explicitly studied torsion in cocompact lattices in coverings of Spin(2, n). The 2-torsion arises from elements in the arithmetic group that act as involutions on the symmetric space. Specifically, elements corresponding to −1 in the spin cover can have order 2. |
| **Classifying space model** | E̲Γ = G/K (the Riemannian symmetric space). |
| **Citation** | \cite{raghunathan1984}, \cite{margulis1991} |

**Note:** Raghunathan's paper is one of the most detailed studies of torsion elements in specific cocompact lattices.

## Example 5: Cocompact Arithmetic Lattice in SL(n, ℝ) via Division Algebras (n ≥ 3)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Ambient group G** | SL(n, ℝ), n ≥ 3 |
| **Real rank** | n − 1 |
| **Symmetric space** | SL(n,ℝ)/SO(n), dimension n(n+1)/2 − 1 |
| **Arithmetic?** | Yes (all lattices are arithmetic by Margulis for n ≥ 3) |
| **Source of 2-torsion** | For n even: the matrix −I ∈ SL(n, ℝ) has order 2 and lies in any lattice Γ that arises as the group of units of a ℤ-order in a central simple algebra over ℚ that splits at ∞. For n = 2: cocompact lattices in SL(2, ℝ) coming from unit groups of quaternion algebras over ℚ can contain elements of order 2 (e.g., the image of i ∈ ℍ gives an element of order 4, and i² = −1 gives order 2 in the center). More generally, arithmetic lattices in SL(n, ℝ) constructed via ℤ-orders in matrix algebras over number fields contain elements of finite order from units of the ring of integers. |
| **Classifying space model** | E̲Γ = SL(n,ℝ)/SO(n) (contractible symmetric space). |
| **Citation** | \cite{margulis1991}, \cite{borelserre1973} |

## Example 6: Cocompact Lattice in Product G₁ × G₂ (Irreducible Higher-Rank Lattice)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Ambient group G** | G₁ × G₂ where G₁ = SL(2, ℝ), G₂ = SL(2, ℝ) (or more generally, products of rank-1 groups) |
| **Real rank** | 2 (sum of ranks) |
| **Symmetric space** | ℍ² × ℍ², dimension 4 |
| **Arithmetic?** | Yes (irreducible lattices in products of rank-1 groups are arithmetic by Margulis) |
| **Source of 2-torsion** | Arithmetic lattices in SL(2, ℝ) × SL(2, ℝ) coming from units of quaternion algebras over real quadratic fields can contain 2-torsion from the non-trivial elements of the center. The element (−I, −I) has order 2. |
| **Classifying space model** | E̲Γ = ℍ² × ℍ² (product of hyperbolic planes). |
| **Citation** | \cite{margulis1991}, \cite{gelander2012} |

## Example 7: Right-Angled Coxeter Groups as Lattices (Davis Construction)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Ambient group G** | Not a classical semisimple Lie group, but a right-angled Coxeter group W acts on the Davis complex Σ, which is a CAT(0) manifold |
| **Real rank** | N/A (this is a comparison case) |
| **Symmetric space** | Davis complex Σ (contractible) |
| **Arithmetic?** | No (Coxeter groups are not lattices in semisimple groups in general) |
| **Source of 2-torsion** | All generators of a Coxeter group have order 2 (they are reflections). This is the prototypical source of 2-torsion. |
| **Classifying space model** | E̲W = Σ (Davis complex). Any torsion-free subgroup W' ⊂ W gives W'\Σ as an aspherical manifold. |
| **Citation** | \cite{davis1983}, \cite{davisbook2008} |

**Note:** This is not a lattice in a semisimple Lie group but serves as a useful comparison. The Davis construction shows that groups with abundant 2-torsion CAN act properly and cocompactly on contractible manifolds — but the quotient is an orbifold, not a manifold. To get a manifold quotient, one MUST pass to a torsion-free subgroup (for the aspherical case).

## Summary

| # | G | rank_ℝ(G) | dim(G/K) | Arithmetic? | Source of 2-torsion | Manifold model? |
|---|---|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | SO(n, 1) | 1 | n | Yes | Reflections | Γ\ℍⁿ orbifold |
| 2 | SU(n, 1) | 1 | 2n | Yes | Anti-holomorphic involutions | Γ\ℂℍⁿ orbifold |
| 3 | Sp(n, 1) | 1 | 4n | Yes | Quaternionic involutions | Γ\ℍℍⁿ orbifold |
| 4 | SO(2, n) | 2 | 2n | Yes | Spin cover elements | Orbifold |
| 5 | SL(n, ℝ) | n−1 | n(n+1)/2−1 | Yes | Central element −I | Orbifold |
| 6 | SL(2,ℝ)² | 2 | 4 | Yes | (−I, −I) | Orbifold |
| 7 | Coxeter W | N/A | varies | No | All generators | Davis complex orbifold |

**Key observation:** In every case, when Γ has 2-torsion, the standard model Γ\G/K is an orbifold, not a manifold. The question is whether a DIFFERENT manifold M (not Γ\G/K) can have π₁(M) = Γ with ℚ-acyclic universal cover.
