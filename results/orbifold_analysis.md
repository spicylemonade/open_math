# Orbifold Analysis: Γ\G/K for Uniform Lattices with Torsion

## 1. When Is Γ\G/K a Manifold?

**Theorem.** Let G be a connected semisimple Lie group with finite center, K ⊂ G a maximal compact subgroup, and Γ ⊂ G a discrete subgroup acting properly on X = G/K. Then:

$$\Gamma \backslash X \text{ is a manifold} \iff \Gamma \text{ acts freely on } X \iff \Gamma \text{ is torsion-free.}$$

**Proof.**

(⇐) If Γ is torsion-free and acts properly discontinuously on X, the action is free: if γ ∈ Γ fixes some x ∈ X, then γ lies in the stabilizer Stab_G(x), which is conjugate to K (since X = G/K and K = Stab_G(eK)). Since K is compact and Γ is discrete, Stab_Γ(x) = Γ ∩ gKg⁻¹ is finite. But Γ is torsion-free, so Stab_Γ(x) = {e}. Therefore Γ acts freely, and Γ\X is a manifold (covering space theory).

(⇒) Conversely, if Γ has an element γ of finite order p > 1, then γ lies in some compact subgroup of G (since γ generates a finite, hence compact, subgroup). By the Cartan fixed-point theorem, any compact subgroup of G fixes a point in X (since X has non-positive curvature). So γ fixes some x ∈ X, meaning Γ does not act freely, and Γ\X has an orbifold singularity at the image of x.

## 2. Rational Cohomology of the Orbifold Γ\X via the Cartan–Leray Spectral Sequence

When Γ has torsion, Γ\X is an orbifold. The rational cohomology can be analyzed via the Cartan–Leray spectral sequence for the covering X → Γ\X.

**Setup.** Since X = G/K is contractible, we have a spectral sequence:

$$E_2^{p,q} = H^p(\Gamma; H^q(X; \mathbb{Q})) \Rightarrow H^{p+q}(\Gamma \backslash X; \mathbb{Q})$$

Since X is contractible, H^q(X; ℚ) = 0 for q ≥ 1 and H^0(X; ℚ) = ℚ (trivial Γ-module). Therefore:

$$E_2^{p,q} = \begin{cases} H^p(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q}) & \text{if } q = 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } q \geq 1 \end{cases}$$

The spectral sequence collapses at E₂, giving:

$$H^*(\Gamma \backslash X; \mathbb{Q}) \cong H^*(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q})$$

**Key point:** This isomorphism holds WHETHER OR NOT Γ has torsion. The orbifold Γ\X (or more precisely, the Borel construction X ×_Γ EΓ) has rational cohomology equal to the group cohomology H*(Γ; ℚ). This is because:

1. The orbifold Γ\X is rationally equivalent to the classifying space BΓ.
2. Over ℚ, the orbifold singularities are "invisible" — they contribute only torsion to integral cohomology.

## 3. Explicit Computation: Example 1 — Triangle Group Δ(2, 3, 7) in SO(2, 1)

Consider the (2, 3, 7) triangle group Γ = Δ(2, 3, 7), which is a cocompact lattice in PSL(2, ℝ) ≅ SO₀(2, 1).

**Presentation:** Γ = ⟨a, b, c | a² = b³ = c⁷ = abc = 1⟩

**2-torsion:** The element a has order 2.

**Symmetric space:** ℍ² (hyperbolic plane), dim = 2.

**Orbifold:** Γ\ℍ² is a compact hyperbolic 2-orbifold — a sphere with three cone points of orders 2, 3, and 7.

**Orbifold Euler characteristic:**
$$\chi^{orb}(\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}^2) = \frac{1}{|\text{trivial}|} \left(2 - 2g - \sum_i (1 - 1/n_i)\right)$$
For a sphere with cone points (2, 3, 7):
$$\chi^{orb} = 2 - (1 - 1/2) - (1 - 1/3) - (1 - 1/7) = 2 - 1/2 - 2/3 - 6/7 = 1/42$$

**Rational cohomology:**
$$H^0(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}, \quad H^k(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q}) = 0 \text{ for } k \geq 1$$
This is because Γ has a torsion-free subgroup of finite index (a surface group) with vcd = 2, and by the transfer map, H^k(Γ; ℚ) ≅ H^k(Γ'; ℚ)^{Γ/Γ'} (after averaging). For the surface group Γ' of a genus-g surface with [Γ : Γ'] = N, we get χ(Γ') = N · χ^{orb} = N/42. Since Γ' is a surface group, H¹(Γ'; ℚ) has dimension 2g where 2 − 2g = N/42, giving g = 1 − N/84.

The key point: H*(Γ; ℚ) is the "averaged" cohomology, and the orbifold singularities only contribute torsion to integral cohomology.

**2-torsion creates orbifold singularity:** The element a ∈ Γ of order 2 fixes a point in ℍ². The image of this fixed point in Γ\ℍ² is a cone point of angle π, which is a Z/2 orbifold singularity.

## 4. Explicit Computation: Example 2 — Arithmetic Lattice in SO(3, 1) with Reflections

Consider a cocompact arithmetic lattice Γ in SO(3, 1) ≅ Isom⁺(ℍ³) that is generated by reflections in the faces of a compact hyperbolic tetrahedron.

**Symmetric space:** ℍ³, dim = 3.

**2-torsion:** Each generating reflection has order 2. Products of two reflections in faces meeting at dihedral angle π/n have order n.

**Orbifold:** Γ\ℍ³ is a compact hyperbolic 3-orbifold (the tetrahedron itself, with mirrored faces).

**Orbifold singularities from 2-torsion:** Each reflection fixes a totally geodesic 2-dimensional submanifold (a face of the tetrahedron). The image in the orbifold is a codimension-1 mirror — the orbifold has a silvered boundary (though as an orbifold it has no boundary in the orbifold sense).

**Rational cohomology:**
For a reflection group Γ generated by reflections in a compact polyhedron P ⊂ ℍ³:
- By Selberg's lemma, there exists Γ' ⊂ Γ torsion-free of finite index.
- Γ'\ℍ³ is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M'.
- H^k(Γ; ℚ) ≅ H^k(M'; ℚ)^{Γ/Γ'} (transfer).
- For closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds: H^0 ≅ H^3 ≅ ℚ, H^1 ≅ H^2 may be non-trivial.
- After taking Γ/Γ'-invariants, typically H^0(Γ; ℚ) ≅ ℚ and H^k(Γ; ℚ) may or may not vanish for 1 ≤ k ≤ 2.

**Euler characteristic:** χ(Γ) = vol(Γ\ℍ³)/vol(P) · χ^{orb}(P). For hyperbolic 3-orbifolds, the orbifold Euler characteristic is related to the volume by the Gauss–Bonnet formula.

## 4. Comparison: H*(BΓ; ℚ) vs H*(Γ\G/K; ℚ)

For a discrete group Γ acting properly on a contractible space X:

**When Γ is torsion-free:**
- Γ\X is a manifold and is a K(Γ, 1) = BΓ.
- H*(Γ\X; ℚ) = H*(BΓ; ℚ) = H*(Γ; ℚ). All three agree.

**When Γ has torsion:**
- BΓ is infinite-dimensional (since Γ has torsion, any model for EΓ must be infinite-dimensional).
- Γ\X is a compact orbifold of dimension dim(X).
- H*(Γ\X; ℚ) still computes H*(Γ; ℚ) (by the spectral sequence argument above), BUT this is the cohomology of the orbifold as a "rational homotopy type," not as a topological space in the naive sense.
- More precisely, the orbifold cohomology H*_{orb}(Γ\X; ℚ) ≅ H*(Γ; ℚ) uses the Borel construction (homotopy quotient) X ×_Γ EΓ → BΓ.
- The "naive" topological cohomology of Γ\X as a topological space may differ from H*(Γ; ℚ) due to the orbifold singularities.

**Conclusion for our problem:** If M is a closed manifold (not orbifold) with π₁(M) = Γ and ℚ-acyclic M̃, then H*(M; ℚ) ≅ H*(Γ; ℚ) (by the same spectral sequence, since M̃ is ℚ-acyclic). So M is a "manifold model" that rationally computes the same thing as the orbifold Γ\G/K, but without orbifold singularities.
