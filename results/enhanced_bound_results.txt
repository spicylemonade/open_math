ENHANCED DELSARTE LP BOUND WITH DIMENSIONAL INTEGRATION CONSTRAINTS
========================================================================

Method: Polynomial ansatz search with Gegenbauer coefficient verification
        + three dimensional integration constraints (D1, D2, D3).

Constraints:
  A1: f(t) <= 0 for t in [-1, 0.5]  (Delsarte nonpositivity)
  A2: f_k >= 0 for all k             (Gegenbauer coefficient positivity)
  D1: Contact graph degree <= tau_{n-1}  (equatorial slicing)
  D2: trace(G^2) >= k^2/n             (second-moment / rank constraint)
  D3: Cross-dim Gegenbauer consistency (volume recurrence V_n=(2pi/n)V_{n-2})

  Dimensional Constraint Details (best polynomial):
    D1: No known tau_2 to constrain degree.
    D2: trace(G^2) in [65.3, 59.5]. Max k from trace: 9.0 (binding for k=14).
    D3: Cross-dim check skipped: n-2=1 < 2 (weight singular).

Redundancy Analysis for n=3
--------------------------------------------------

D1 (Equatorial Slicing):
  No known tau_2; constraint not applicable.

D2 (Second-Moment Trace):
  trace(G^2) in [65.3, 59.5]
  Max k from trace: 9.0
  For n=3: max k from trace = 9. Delsarte gives ~13.
  The trace IS binding here but is weaker than our LP bound.

D3 (Volume Recurrence Consistency):
  Consistency measure: 0.0000
  Ratios computed: 0
  The volume recurrence V_n = (2*pi/n)*V_{n-2} relates cap geometry across
  dimensions, but the Delsarte polynomial is an LP certificate, NOT a cap
  indicator. Its Gegenbauer coefficients need not satisfy cross-dimensional
  consistency.
  WHY REDUNDANT: D3 is a geometric constraint on real configurations;
  the LP certificate lives in a dual polynomial space where cross-dimensional
  consistency is not required for a valid bound.

OVERALL CONCLUSION:
  The dimensional constraints (D1-D3) operate at a different level than the
  Delsarte LP. The LP is a spectral (global) method; the dimensional constraints
  are geometric (local/structural). For n=5, the LP bound of 44 is already tight
  enough that none of D1-D3 can further restrict the polynomial search space.

  To improve below 44, one would need:
    (a) SDP / 3-point bounds (Bachoc-Vallentin 2008, Mittelmann-Vallentin 2010)
    (b) Constraints interacting directly with the Gegenbauer expansion
    (c) Fundamentally new techniques (flag algebras, modular forms)

Redundancy Analysis for n=4
--------------------------------------------------

D1 (Equatorial Slicing):
  The constraint deg(v) <= tau_3 = 12 limits contact graph degree.
  Our bound gives at most None points.
  WHY REDUNDANT: The LP constrains total point count (global), while D1
  constrains local structure. The LP bound is already small enough that
  any contact graph fits within the degree bound.

D2 (Second-Moment Trace):
  For n=4 >= 4, the trace constraint gives k <= infinity.
  WHY REDUNDANT: The rank constraint trace(G^2) >= k^2/4 is too weak;
  the inequality 4k <= 4(k+3) is always satisfied for positive k.

D3 (Volume Recurrence Consistency):
  The volume recurrence V_n = (2*pi/n)*V_{n-2} relates cap geometry across
  dimensions, but the Delsarte polynomial is an LP certificate, NOT a cap
  indicator. Its Gegenbauer coefficients need not satisfy cross-dimensional
  consistency.

    D3: Cross-dim consistency (CoV of h(n,k)/h(n-2,k)): 0.7368. 15 harmonic dimension ratios computed. Expected volume ratio 2*pi/5 = 1.2566.

Redundancy Analysis for n=5
--------------------------------------------------

D1 (Equatorial Slicing):
  The constraint deg(v) <= tau_4 = 24 limits contact graph degree.
  Our bound gives at most 51 points.
  With 51 points and max degree 24, the contact graph
  is always feasible (max edges = 612).
  WHY REDUNDANT: The LP constrains total point count (global), while D1
  constrains local structure. The LP bound is already small enough that
  any contact graph fits within the degree bound.

D2 (Second-Moment Trace):
  trace(G^2) in [520.2, 688.5]
  Max k from trace: inf
  For n=5 >= 4, the trace constraint gives k <= infinity.
  WHY REDUNDANT: The rank constraint trace(G^2) >= k^2/5 is too weak;
  the inequality 4k <= 5(k+3) is always satisfied for positive k.

D3 (Volume Recurrence Consistency):
  Consistency measure: 0.7368
  Ratios computed: 15
  The volume recurrence V_n = (2*pi/n)*V_{n-2} relates cap geometry across

FINAL COMMENTARY
========================================================================

The enhanced bound with dimensional integration constraints does NOT
improve below the standard Delsarte LP bound for any tested dimension.

For n=5 specifically:
  Our enhanced bound: tau_5 <= 51
  Delsarte LP bound:  tau_5 <= 44  (from literature)
  Known:              40 <= tau_5 <= 44

WHY THE DIMENSIONAL CONSTRAINTS DON'T HELP:

1. The Delsarte LP operates in a DUAL SPACE of polynomials. The bound
   f(1)/f_0 is determined by the Gegenbauer expansion, which encodes
   spectral information about S^{n-1}. The dimensional constraints
   (equatorial degree, trace, volume recurrence) encode GEOMETRIC
   information about real configurations, which does not directly
   restrict the space of valid LP certificates.

2. The equatorial slicing constraint (D1) bounds vertex degrees, but
   the LP bound already gives at most 44 points, and any graph on
   44 vertices can have max degree <= 24 = tau_4.

3. The trace constraint (D2) is vacuous for n >= 4 because the rank
   constraint trace(G^2) >= k^2/n is too weak relative to the diagonal
   bound trace(G^2) <= k(k+3)/4.

4. The volume recurrence (D3) relates cap geometry across dimensions,
   but the LP polynomial is a certificate, not a geometric object. Its
   Gegenbauer coefficients are not required to satisfy cross-dimensional
   consistency.

WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE BOUND:
  - Semidefinite programming (SDP) with 3-point or k-point constraints
    (Bachoc-Vallentin 2008, Mittelmann-Vallentin 2010)
  - These constrain the TRIPLE correlation function, which the LP ignores.
  - For n=5, SDP gives tau_5 <= 44 (matching LP), so even 3-point
    constraints are not sufficient to improve further.
  - A breakthrough would require Viazovska-type methods (modular forms)
    or a clever new construction proving tau_5 >= 41.
